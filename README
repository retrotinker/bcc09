Object file format produced by assembler and consumed by linker is the
"INTROL LINKABLE BINARY FILE FORMAT", documented in "INTROL LINKER
AND LOADER REFERENCE MANUAL", available here:

So theoretically, object modules should be compatible with objects
generated by the Introl-C/6809 toolchain -- YMMV!  The calling
conventions would still need to match...
