- Expand README (and add FAQ)
- Audit bcc/bcc.doc for accuracy and completeness
- Continue removing unused options and correcting documentation
- Ditto for any remaining x86isms
- Consolidate ld/rel_aout.h and ld/x86_aout.h (as bcc_aout.h?)
- Add some simple startup code and other fundamental support libraries
- Change default PREFIX to /usr/local (when things actually work)
- Parameterize os9copy for version, reentrancy, data size, etc...
- Add data address parameter for decbcopy (or read from a.out header)
- Genericize os9/decbcopy as objcopy; include os9, decb, srec, ihex, etc...
- Remove DATASEGS definition from linker (x86-ism?)
- Remove etextpadoff from linker (x86-ism?)
- Add 'os9' pseudo-op to assembler
- Reenable long and float types in compiler and add required functions
  to compiler runtime library
- Need runtime init of statically initialized pointer data (ctors/dtors?)
  for PIC code (and corresponding support in startup code)
- Improve "-C-p" option for data position independence (for use w/ OS-9)
- In PIC mode, global (bss?) pointers and arrays are using PC-relative
  addressing rather than direct addressing
- Pointers to direct page objects don't work
  (LEAX <_foo -> LDD #_foo ; TFR DP,A ; TFR D,X)
  (           -> LEAS -1,S ; CLR 0,S ; PSHS DP ; PULS X ; LEAX _foo,X)
  (           -> TFR D,X ; TFR DP,A ; CLR B ; EXG D,X ; LEAX _foo,X)
  (           -> TFR D,X ; LDD #_foo ; TFR DP,A ; EXG D,X)
- Create a BUGS file for items like the last two?
- Add support for Color TRSDOS (i.e. Disk EDTASM) environment?
- Add code generation option for 6309
- Implement more/better copt rules
- For hysterical reasons, change a.out magic to $201e (i.e. BRA $1E)?
- Currently "-C-f-" does _not_ disable "1st arg in register" calling protocol...
- Ditto for "-C-c-" and "caller saves"...
- Include heap start (i.e. U reg) in environment for OS-9 (e.g. "HEAPSTART=0x6E00")
- Plenty more...
